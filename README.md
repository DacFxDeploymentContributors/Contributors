# DacFx Deployment Contributors

## What is this?

This is a repository of some useful deployment contributors that anyone can use. Please feel free to submit any contributors that you have written as pull requests.

##Some rules

- MIT license, if you need another license please ask or submit a PR with an additional license these are for people to use

- Submit a separate visual studio solution for each contributor, please include unit /integration tests and a doc on how to use the contributor. The doc doesn't have to be too much just the args you pass to it to run it etc 

- If you need any help, post on stack overflow with the ssdt tag (<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ssdt>) or the msdn ssdt forum (<https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-us/home?forum=ssdt>), on twitter mention @EdDebug (<https://twitter.com/eddebug>) or contact me via my blog (<https://the.agilesql.club>) and I will be happy to help :)
