# DeploymentPlanLogger

This is an example deployment contributor that is useful to show what steps make up a plan, it has a message box at the beginning so you can attach visual studio and step through the code. It is for learning about contributors rather than being anything actually useful.

See https://the.agilesql.club/blog/Ed-Elliott/2015/09/30/Deployment-Contributor-Logger-Useful-For-Experimentation for details on what the hell this is and why it exists :)
