EditionAwareCreateIndex

The point of this is that when you have enterprise you can create an index using WITH(ONLINE=on) but if you try to do that with standard edition it will fail as it doesn't support it.

There is no way (that I know of) to see what edition you are targetting from a deployment contributor so there are two ways to use it, by default it will take an existing create index statement and wrap it in a check for the edition. This means that no matter what edition you have you can use this online if you have enterprise.

If you know what edition you have you can pass either:

 /p:AdditionalDeploymentContributorArguments==EditionAwareCreateIndexForceEdition=Enterprise

and you will get WITH(ONLINE=ON), or:

 /p:AdditionalDeploymentContributorArguments==EditionAwareCreateIndexForceEdition=Standard

and you will not get ONLINE.

To load this contributor add:

/p:AdditionalDeploymentContributors=EditionAwareCreateIndex
